Direct measurements
10 	Singlebeam - depth value collected by a single beam echo-sounder
11 	Multibeam - depth value collected by a multibeam echo-sounder
12 	Seismic - depth value collected by seismic methods
13 	Isolated sounding - depth value that is not part of a regular survey or trackline
14 	ENC sounding - depth value extracted from an Electronic Navigation Chart (ENC)
15 	Lidar - depth derived from a bathymetric lidar sensor
16 	Depth measured by optical light sensor
17 	Combination of direct measurement methods
Indirect measurements
40 	Predicted based on satellite-derived gravity data - depth value is an interpolated value guided by satellite-derived gravity data
41 	Interpolated based on a computer algorithm - depth value is an interpolated value based on a computer algorithm (e.g. Generic Mapping Tools)
42 	Digital bathymetric contours from charts - depth value taken from a bathymetric contour data set
43 	Digital bathymetric contours from ENCs - depth value taken from bathymetric contours from an Electronic Navigation Chart (ENC)
44 	Bathymetric sounding - depth value at this location is constrained by bathymetric sounding(s) within a gridded data set where interpolation between sounding points is guided by satellite-derived gravity data
45 	Predicted based on helicopter/flight-derived gravity data
46 	Depth estimated by calculating the draft of a grounded iceberg using satellite-derived freeboard measurement.
Unknown
70 	Pre-generated grid - depth value is taken from a pre-generated grid that is based on mixed source data types, e.g. single beam, multibeam, interpolation etc.
71 	Unknown source - depth value from an unknown source
72 	Steering points - depth value used to constrain the grid in areas of poor data coverage
